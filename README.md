# CHOCOLATE-TRUFFLE-CAKE

This recipe is about how to make a chocolate truffle cake.
It is a very easy and simple recipe.


<h1>INGREDIENTS<h1>


<h4>**450g** caramel toffee<h4>


**100g** dark chocolate (70% cocoa), chopped


**2 x 200g** bars milk chocolate , chopped


**142ml** pot double cream


**1 tsp** vanilla extract


About **85g** cocoa powder , to coat



<h1>Method<h1>


<h3>STEP 1<h3>


Make the middles first. Heat the Dulce de Leche in a pan for 1 min until warmed and runny, then stir in the chopped dark chocolate and leave to melt. Stir until smooth. Cover a dinner plate with cling film, oil the cling film well, then tip the mix onto it. Cool, then freeze for 2 hrs or until very firm.

STEP 2


Put the milk chocolate into a bowl. Bring the cream to the boil in another pan, then pour it over the chocolate. Leave for 2 mins, then add the vanilla and stir until smooth. Cool, then chill until set.

STEP 3


Peel the caramel from the cling film, then snip into thumbnail-size pieces; wet kitchen scissors work best. Spread cocoa powder over a large baking tray. Take a heaped tsp of the truffle mix then, with cocoa-dusted hands, poke in a caramel chunk. Squash the mix around the caramel to seal, then roll into a ball. Put onto the tray, then shake to coat in the cocoa. Repeat with the rest of the mix, then freeze, or chill if making less than 3 days ahead.
